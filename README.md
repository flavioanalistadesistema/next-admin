List of what was used to develop this project:

*   ## Tailwind css : [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

`Tailwind make it easy to be consistent with color choices, spacing, typography, shadows, and everything else that makes up a well-engineered design system.`

*   ## API Context/Hook [API Context](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

`API Context is suitable for sharing data that can be considered global. Hooks play a key role in creating each context`

*   ## Firebase : [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

`Firebase helps build and run apps, in this project I used firebase authentication service`

Every layout follows the responsive pattern, also developed to change the theme colors, working well on all devices and following good development practices.
